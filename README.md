# NKU-Stat-AI-Seminar
A collection of papers and slides from the Frontier Seminar in Statistics and AI at Nankai University's School of Statistics and Data Science.

## About the Seminar

The Frontier Seminar in Statistics and AI is a initiative dedicated to exploring the forefront of research in data science. The seminar is organized thematically, with each session providing an in-depth analysis of a specific cutting-edge topic through the lens of both classic and contemporary research literature.

Our discussions have covered a diverse range of subjects, including **Transfer Learning**, the phenomenon of **Benign Overfitting**, and the architecture of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. We are proud to have featured presentations from a talented group of undergraduate and graduate students from world-renowned institutions such as **Columbia University**, **Peking University**, and **Nankai University**.

**What's Next?**
The upcoming sessions will be dedicated to the exciting field of **Computational Optimal Transport**, which I will be leading. We will dissect key papers and explore their impact.

We hope this repository becomes a valuable resource for all participants and followers.
